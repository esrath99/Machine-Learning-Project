# Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning Techniques

# Objective
This project aims to apply machine learning algorithms to predict the risk of heart disease using patient health data.

# Project Workflow
 Dataset: Utilized a public dataset of patient health data, which was preprocessed for model training and testing.
 
 Feature encoding: Used label encoding to convert categorical data into numerical format.
 
 Imbalanced Dataset Handling: Applied SMOTETomek techniques to balance classe.
 
 Algorithms: The following algorithms were used: Gaussian Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost, XGBoost, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree, 
 and Random Forest.
 
 Results: Random Forest achieved the highest accuracy of 90%, making it the most effective model for predicting heart disease.
