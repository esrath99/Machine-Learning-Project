# Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning Techniques

# Objective
This project aims to apply machine learning algorithms to predict the risk of heart disease using patient health data.

# Problem Statement
Heart disease remains one of the leading causes of death globally, and effective risk prediction is essential for improving patient outcomes. Traditional diagnostic methods can be costly and resource-intensive, limiting access to timely care. This project aims to utilize machine learning algorithms to analyze patient health data and identify individuals at a higher risk of developing heart disease. By providing accurate risk assessments, this approach can support healthcare professionals in making more informed, data-driven decisions, ultimately enhancing the quality of care and reducing mortality rates.

# Project Workflow
 **Dataset**: Utilized a public dataset of patient health data with 319,795 rows and 18 columns, which was preprocessed for model training and testing.
 
 **Feature encoding**: Used label encoding to convert categorical data into numerical format.
 
 **Imbalanced Dataset Handling**: Applied SMOTETomek techniques to balance classe.
 
 **Algorithms**: The following algorithms were used: Gaussian Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost, XGBoost, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree and Random Forest.
 
 **Results**: Random Forest achieved the highest accuracy of 90%, making it the most effective model for predicting heart disease.
